        <article class="article row d-flex justify-content-center">
            <p class="lead article__par col-sm-8 col-md-6 col-lg-4">First conceived by former president Hiroshi Yamauchi around mid-2002, the codenamed <strong>Project Nitro</strong> began development as an experiment inside Nintendo's headquarters. The idea was to create a dual-screen handheld console, along the lines of some Game & Watch models from the 80's which had a clam-shell design and two screens. The mission was to bring a different, unconventional kind of console that would take advantage of unexplored technologies at the time.</p>

                <p class="letter lead col-sm-8 col-md-8 col-lg-6">After some years of intensive development and during hard times at Nintendo due to the low sales of the Gamecube, yet with a strong grip on the portable market with the Game Boy Advance, Reggie Fils-Aime unveiled Nintendo's next-gen console: the <strong>Nintendo DS</strong>.</p>
            </div>
            <iframe class="col-md-6 col-lg-5" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TaA-lYUQom0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p class="lead col-sm-8 col-md-6 col-lg-4">All it took was Reggie's reaching his suit's left pocket to change the world of gaming. Under Nintendo's philosophy of innovation before horsepower, the Nintendo DS was shown as a game-changer for developers and gamers alike, offering a world of possibilities and game mechanics that seemed impossible on any console at the time, let alone a handheld. <strong>Two displays</strong>, <strong>touch input</strong>, a <strong>microphone</strong>, <strong>Wi-Fi</strong> compatibility to play with people around the globe. So many features crammed into a <strong>pocketable</strong> piece of tech!</p>
            <p class="lead col-sm-8 col-md-6 col-lg-4">It was a no-brainer: the Nintendo DS launched on December 2004 in both North America and Japan and sold almost <strong>3 million units</strong> on a single month. And with each new iterarion of the console, the sales number only went higher and higher. As of 2016, there were a whopping <strong>154.02 million</strong> units sold, leaving the DS as not only Nintendo's best-selling handheld (surpassing even the mythical <strong>Game Boy</strong>), but their best-selling console of all time.</p>
